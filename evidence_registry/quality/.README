# Quality Evidence Artifacts

**Purpose:** Prove CI/CD gates prevent invalid states and semantic drift.

## Required Artifacts:

### Future CI Integration (Phase E, documented only)
- `ci_output.txt` - CI pipeline execution logs
- `contract_drift_detection.txt` - oasdiff outputs showing breaking change detection
- `test_failure_artifacts/` - Directory containing intentional failure evidence

## Evidence Standards:
- Capture full CI/CD pipeline outputs
- Document both passing and failing builds
- Show semantic drift rejection
- Include linter outputs
- Test coverage reports

## Exit Gate Requirements:
- CI rejects contract drift
- Lint errors fail pipeline
- Schema inconsistencies caught
- Breaking changes detected
- All quality gates proven operational

## Note:
Phase B0.1 focuses on local validation. Full CI integration evidence deferred to later phases.
