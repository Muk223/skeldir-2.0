# Runtime Evidence Artifacts

**Purpose:** Capture empirical evidence of process orchestration, service availability, and runtime environment state.

## Required Artifacts:

### Baseline Capture (Phase B)
- `process_snapshot.txt` - Output of `ps aux` showing running processes
- `open_ports.txt` - Output of `lsof -i` showing port bindings
- `env_dump.txt` - Environment variables and PATH configuration
- `binary_checks.txt` - Binary availability tests (uvicorn, celery, psql, prism, python imports)
- `nix_baseline.txt` - Current replit.nix configuration and missing packages

### Post-Remediation Validation (Phase D)
- `init_log.txt` - Output from scripts/init_runtime.sh execution
- `running_processes.txt` - Process snapshot after services started
- `port_bindings.txt` - Port bindings after services started
- `connectivity_tests.txt` - Health check results for all services

## Evidence Standards:
- All artifacts must include timestamps
- All command outputs stored verbatim
- Failures are valid evidence (document, don't suppress)
- Include execution context (working directory, user, environment)

## Exit Gate Requirements:
- FastAPI, Celery, PostgreSQL, Redis, Prism all running with distinct PIDs
- Services responding to connectivity tests
- No CrashLoopBackOff states
