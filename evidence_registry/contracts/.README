# Contract Evidence Artifacts

**Purpose:** Prove contract authority, consistency, validation, and enforcement.

## Required Artifacts:

### Baseline Capture (Phase B)
- `backend_route_map.txt` - All FastAPI routes with operation_ids and paths
- `contract_operations_map.txt` - All OpenAPI operations from bundled contracts
- `route_contract_gaps.txt` - Comparison showing routes without contracts and contracts without routes

### Validation Framework (Phase E)
- `contract_validation_log.txt` - Output from validate-contracts.sh execution
- `fidelity_test_results.txt` - Pytest results from route-contract mapping tests
- `drift_detection_proof.txt` - Evidence of semantic drift detection working

### Interim Semantics (Phase F)
- `interim_semantics_proof.json` - API response showing verified=false with upgrade_notice

## Evidence Standards:
- Machine-readable outputs (JSON, structured text)
- Include validation tool versions
- Capture both passing and intentionally failing tests
- Document expected vs actual outcomes

## Exit Gate Requirements:
- All contracts pass OpenAPI validation
- Backend routes map 1:1 to contract operations
- Drift detection catches schema changes
- API returns contract-compliant interim responses
