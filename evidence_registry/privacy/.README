# Privacy Evidence Artifacts

**Purpose:** Prove PII cannot persist through runtime stripping and database guardrails (defense-in-depth).

## Required Artifacts:

### Baseline Capture (Phase B)
- `current_controls.txt` - Documentation of existing PII controls (DB triggers, middleware status)

### Active Defense (Phase G)
- `pii_stripping_test.txt` - Evidence of middleware stripping PII before DB
- `defense_in_depth_proof.txt` - Evidence of DB triggers blocking PII that bypasses middleware

## Evidence Standards:
- Show PII in request payload
- Show [REDACTED] in stored data
- Document both layers of defense
- Include middleware logs
- Test multiple PII key types (email, phone, address, ip, ssn)

## Exit Gate Requirements:
- Middleware strips PII keys before application logic
- Database contains [REDACTED] not actual PII
- DB triggers provide backup defense
- API returns 200 OK (graceful handling)
- Both defense layers proven operational
