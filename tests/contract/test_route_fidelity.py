"""
Route-Contract Fidelity Tests - Phase E
Validates 1:1 mapping between FastAPI routes and OpenAPI contract operations.

Exit criteria:
- Every in-scope FastAPI route has a corresponding OpenAPI operation
- Every OpenAPI operation has a corresponding FastAPI route (or is allowlisted)
- Operation IDs match between implementation and contract
